Fixed Income is an investing approach focused on the preservation of capital and income. It usually entails investments into bonds (government and corporate), certificate deposits, and money market funds. Goal is to achieve steady income while minimizing risk compared to equities.

## Benefits of fixed income

1. **Diversification** from the equities markets
2. **Long-term** investment horizon
3. **Preservation** of capital due to less exposure to volatility
4. **Fixed income** on a regular basis, providing a reliable and consistent income stream

## Risks of fixed income

1. **Interest rate risk** because when rates rise it will cause bond prices to fall (inverse relationship). When savings interest rates rise, bond interest rates become less attractive
2. **Inflation risk** because when inflation gets closer to bond interest rates or even outpaces it, you lose purchasing power
3. **Credit risk** as corporate bonds have an inherent business and financial risk
4. **Liquidity risks** when failing to find an asset buyer
