1. formulate the The Null hypothesis: not guilty
2. formulate the Alternative hyptohesis: guilty

3. collect data

4. Could the null hyptothesis plasuibly have happended by chance if the null hypothesis were true. Or in even simpler terms: Can the person be innocent, even if he looks guilty.

5. yes, suggests innocent: failed to reject the null hyptohesis (failed to reject, but not stated as true because data is not sufficient to prove it). not innocent, simply not sufficient evidence to convict. might or might not be innocent (ordinary state)
6. no: data suggest guily: we reject null hyptohesis in favor of alternative hypothesis (in data science it's the burden of the data scientst to prove the "unusual", aka. not the ordinary state)

test

1. start with a null hypothesis $ H_0 $ that represents the status quo
2. set an alternative hypothesis $ H_A $ that represents the research question (what we are testing for)
3. conduct hyptothesis under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true
   1. if the results suggests that the data is does not provide convicing evidence for the alternative hypothesis (via simulation or theoretical methods), we stick with the null hypothesis, or in different words: we failed to reject the null hyptohesis
   2. Otherwise, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis
