Prior probability is a term in Bayesian statistical inference. It is the best prediction of the outcome of an experiment based only on the currently available information (data). In statistical terms, we only know the probability of event A to be occurring. Therefore our prior is $ P(A) $.

### Revising the belief

The prior probability will be updated as additional information becomes available. Revising the prior with additional insights usually helps to make better predictions about the outcome. Once the prior probability was updated it becomes the posterior probability. The posterior probability describes the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. In statistical terms $P(A|B)$.

### Example

We want to predict if a certain soccer player will score a goal in a certain match. We do have prior observations about the players and the teams' performance. This is our prior probability. Let's call it event A.

During the game, an additional event, event B, which affects the probability of event A occurred. With this additional information, we can formulate the posterior. Because event B is affecting event A and because event B happened after event A, we can revise our prior probability of event A occurring. It's now our posterior probability.
