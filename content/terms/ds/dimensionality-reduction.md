Dimensionality reduction aims to transform data from a high-dimensional space (many varriables) into a low-dimensional space (fewer variables) which still captures the essence of the data.

### Applications of dimensionality reduction

- reduce data size and hence storage requirements
- most models perform better with fewer dimensions
- perform noise reduction
- remove multi-colinearity
- visualize higher-dimensional data

### Approaches to dimensionality reduction

There are two common approaches to dimensionality reduction

- linear approach
- non-linear approach

With further classification into two types

- feature selection
- feature extraction

### Dimensionality reduction techniques

#### Linear

- Principal component analysis (PCA)
- Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
- Linear Discriminant Analaysis (LDA)

#### Non-linear

- Kernel PCA
- Linear Discriminant Analaysis (LDA)
- Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA)
- Autoencoder
- t-SNE
- UMAP
