A mutual fund is a company that pools money from investors to invest it in securities, bonds, and short-term debt. Therefore a mutual fund is an actual company and an investment. The portfolio is actively managed by fund managers.

## Earning returns from mutual fund investing

By buying shares of the fund, you are effectively buying into its overall performance. These shares however do not grant any voting rights. The value of a share is determined by dividing the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund by all its outstanding shares (meaning shares held by stakeholders). Mutual fund share prices do not fluctuate intra day as they are settled at the end of the day.

## Mutual fund income types

1. **Dividends** earned on stocks and **interest** on bond holdings. The income is usually payed out as a distribution. A share holder usually has the option to re-invest the earnings for more shares.
2. **Capital gains** when the fund sells securities that have increased in price.
3. **Increased share price** when the mutual fund holdings appreciate, the share price does so, too. Earnings are not materialized until you sell your shares in the market.

## Mutual fund fees

Mutual fund fees fall under annual operating fees and shareholder fees.

- **Annual operating fees** range from 1% to 3% and covers management and administrative fees. This fee is also known as expense ratio.
- **Shareholder fees** are levied as sales charges, commissions, or redemption fees. These fees are referred to as "the load" of a fund. A fund is front loaded if the fees are are assessed when shares are bought, and as back loaded if the fees are assessed on sell.

Some funds charge early withdrawal fees. Expense ratios and loads can cause an attractive fund to effectively generate less return than other investments

- **Global and international funds** invest into assets globally or outside the home country of the fund
